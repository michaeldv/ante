    Ante is an esoteric programming language where all you've got is a deck of
    playing cards.


FOUR REGISTERS, ZERO INITIALIZED

    ♦ ♥ ♠ ♣

OPERATORS, SEQUENTIAL PRECEDENCE

    ♦  # Add
    ♥  # Multiply
    ♠  # Subtract
    ♣  # Divide

SYNTAX

    2-9[x]...     # Assignment; the suit of first card designates
                  # target register
    A[x]          # Current value of register [x] (the Ace aces it)
    K[x]          # Jump to the last Q[x] label if A[x] != 0 (go see the Queen)
    Q[x]          # Label (the Queen is waiting)
    J[x]          # Print A[x] as character (Jack shows the goods)
   10[x]          # Print A[x] as number

    Kings and Queens can have twins, triplets, etc. of the same suit. While
    single K♥ goes to Q♥, K♥K♥ twins will go to Q♥Q♥ and so on.

EXAMPLE

    # 15.times { |i| print i }
    3♥ 5♥         # ♥ = 3 * 5
    Q♥            # Label
    10♦           # Print current value of ♦
    A♦ 3♦ 2♠      # ♦ = ♦ + 3 - 2
    A♥ 3♠ 2♦      # ♥ = ♥ - 3 + 2
    K♥            # Jump to Q♥ if ♥ != 0
